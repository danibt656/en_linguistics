# *en_linguistics*
A short Python script to experiment with the language and with the structure of linguistics themselves. 

This program procedurally generates a humongous blob of text, comprised of grammatically correct English sentences. It uses a predisposed archive with lots of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs.
