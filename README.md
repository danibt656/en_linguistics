# *en_linguistics*
A short Python script to experiment with the language and with the structure of linguistics themselves. 

This program procedurally generates a humongous blob of text, comprised of grammatically correct English sentences. It uses a predisposed archive with lots of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs.

This project was inspired by the website 'The Library of Babel', which claims to store every book that has been ever written (or will be). You can check it out at: https://libraryofbabel.info/
